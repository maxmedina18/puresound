The Following is a Project Developed by HAUSMEDINA - 
High-Quality Audio Stemming Using U-Net

 "Pure Sound" is a Python-based project that implements a U-Net architecture for high-quality audio separation (stemming). The model takes in mixed audio and outputs separated stems (vocals, instruments, etc.) with minimal noise and high clarity. This project is inspired by advanced audio separation techniques and is designed to help create clean, professional-grade audio stems.

Features

	•	U-Net Architecture: Utilizes a deep learning U-Net model for spectrogram-based audio separation.
	•	Spectrogram Processing: Converts audio files to spectrograms using STFT (Short-Time Fourier Transform) for processing.
	•	Customizable: Fine-tune the model for specific tasks, such as isolating vocals or instruments.
	•	High-Quality Output: Generates clean, well-separated stems that can be used in music production or other audio processing tasks.

Getting Started

These instructions will help you get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools installed:

	•	Python 3.7+
	•	pip package installer
	•	Git

Installation

	1.	Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hausmedina.git
cd hausmedina


	2.	Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate


	3.	Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

The requirements.txt includes:
	•	librosa: For audio processing.
	•	torch: For deep learning model implementation (PyTorch).
	•	numpy, matplotlib: For data manipulation and visualizations.

Usage

	1.	Convert an audio file into a spectrogram:

python audio_to_spectrogram.py --input your_audio_file.wav --output output_spectrogram.png


	2.	Train the U-Net model:
You can train the model on a dataset of mixed audio and stems:

python train.py --data_dir /path_to_dataset --epochs 50 --batch_size 16


	3.	Separate audio using the trained model:
Once the model is trained, you can use it to separate new audio files into stems:

python separate.py --input your_mixed_audio.wav --output_dir /path_to_output_stems


	4.	Visualize the output spectrograms:
The separated stems will be outputted as spectrograms and can be visualized using:

python visualize_output.py --input /path_to_output_stems



Model Architecture

The U-Net architecture is used for audio spectrogram separation:

	•	Encoder-Decoder structure with downsampling layers for compressing the input and upsampling layers for reconstruction.
	•	Skip connections are implemented between corresponding layers in the encoder and decoder to help retain important high-frequency information.

The model operates on 2D spectrograms, making it ideal for frequency-based audio separation tasks.

Dataset

This project uses the MUSDB18 dataset, a popular dataset for music source separation. You can download it from MUSDB18 and place it in your data/ directory.

Results

After training, the model will generate separated stems that you can listen to or further process. The model is evaluated using:

	•	SDR (Source-to-Distortion Ratio)
	•	SIR (Source-to-Interference Ratio)

These metrics will help you assess the quality of the separation.
